Instead, the norm is to pre-train a CNN on a very large dataset and then use these weights as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest (transfer learning).\n",

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model pre-trained on one task is adapted to a different, but related, task. This approach leverages the knowledge and features learned during the initial training to improve performance and reduce data requirements for the new task, making it more efficient and effective.\n",
