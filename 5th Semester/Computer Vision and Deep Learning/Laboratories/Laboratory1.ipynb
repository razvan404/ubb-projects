        "In the last part of this introductory laboratory, you'll \"meet\" a convolutional network for object classification. For now, consider it just as a black box that takes an image as input and outputs the 3-top predictions; however this network requires that the input data has the following properties: the size of the input image must be 224x224, the channels of the image should be stored in RGB format, the type of the data (of the numpy array) is float32 and the pixel values are normalized.\n",
        "\n",
        "More specifically:\n",
        "- resize the image by preserving the aspect ratio, such that its smallest dimension has 232 pixels;\n",
        "- perform a central crop of the image of crop size equal to 224;\n",
        "- rescale the pixels in the image to the interval [0.0, 1.0];\n",
        "- normalize the pixel values using mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] (subtract mean and then divide by the standard deviation).\n",
        "- prior to feeding the image to model.predict() should be added such that the shape of the image is (1, 3, 224, 224) (channels first)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to pre-process the input images such that they are in the format requested by the network."
